# Machine-Learning
This is the project file for the Machine Learning

Three Different Models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Bert
3. R-net-based

And there may need other related datasets, but due to the limitation of git reposity, we don't upload this file.

Before you run the r-net, you need bash setup.sh first.
